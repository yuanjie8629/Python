"""
We are planning for a picnic.
There are some items we would like to carry.
Our knapsack is only able to carry 15 pounds of items.
The items are given with some ratings from 1 to 10 to indicates
how strongly we want to include the particular item in knapsack for the picnic.
Once the item is included in the knapsack, the same item cannot be carried again.

There are total of 6 items as follows:
1. Ant Repellent,1,2
2. Blanket,4,3
3. Brownies,3,10
4. Frisbee,1,6
5. Salad,5,4
6. Watermelon,10,10

Calculate the maximum rating and total weight that the knapsack can take.
